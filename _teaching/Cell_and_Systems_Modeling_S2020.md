This course introduces students to the theory and practice of modeling biological systems from the molecular to the population level with an emphasis on intracellular processes. Topics covered include kinetic and equilibrium descriptions of biological processes, systematic approaches to model building and parameter estimation, analysis of biochemical circuits modeled as differential equations, modeling the effects of noise using stochastic methods. A range of biological models and applications are considered including gene regulatory networks cell signaling, molecular motors, and developmental biology.

For practical assignments students use MATLAB and [BioNetGen](http://bionetgen.org/) to simulate biological networks.
